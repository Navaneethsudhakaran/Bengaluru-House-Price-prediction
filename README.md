# Bengaluru-House-Price-prediction

new  machinelearning project, implemented using MultipleLinearRegression.

Steps to create the required model:
1. Import Libraries
2. Reading Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Cleaning
5. Feature Engineering
6. Dimensionality Reduction
7. Outlier Removal Using Business Logic
8. Outlier Removal Using standard Deviation and Mean
9. Data Visualization
10. Building The Model
11. Testing Model

Feature engineering refers to manipulation - addition, deletion, combination, mutation - of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy. Effective feature engineering is based on sound knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources.
